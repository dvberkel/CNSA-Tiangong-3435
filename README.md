### CNSA Tiangong 3435
The main purpose of the *CNSA Tiangong 3435* is to mine nebula and process the
gases and rare minerals into easily transported form. Being outside the main
trade routes of the Galactic Alliance, life aboard the CNSA Tiangong 3435 can
become a bit repetitive.

The work attracts young people who do a few tours on the Tiangong to make a
quick buck before going to college. They usually welcome any deviation from the tedium.
